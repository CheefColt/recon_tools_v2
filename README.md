# recon_tools_v2

A small set of Bash and Python scripts I use for passive subdomain enumeration, DNS inspection, and link scraping.

⚠️ Note: These tools are for educational and authorized testing purposes only.

## Tools

- `subfinder.sh`: Basic subdomain collection using common resolvers
- `dns_scan.py`: A DNS inspection script
- `urls_scraper.py`: Extracts hrefs and JS links from raw HTML
- `headers.json`: Predefined request headers for scraping

## Usage

## Note

Still testing some auth tools — don't rely on the API module yet.
